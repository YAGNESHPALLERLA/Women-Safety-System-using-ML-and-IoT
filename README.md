# Women Safety System using Random Forest Classifier

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the safety level of different areas based on various factors such as the presence of police stations, bars, residential levels, and the time of day. The dataset used for this project contains information about different zones, their characteristics, and whether they are classified as safe or unsafe. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify areas as safe or unsafe.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Area**: Name of the area.
- **Zone**: Specific zone within the area.
- **Time**: The time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
- **People Frequency**: The frequency of people in the area (Low, Medium, High).
- **Is Police Station Nearby**: Indicates whether there is a police station nearby (Yes/No).
- **Is Bar Nearby**: Indicates whether there is a bar nearby (Yes/No).
- **Tier**: The tier of the area (Middle, Outer).
- **Residence Level**: The level of residential presence in the area (Low, Medium, High).
- **Class**: The target variable indicating the safety level (Safe, Unsafe).
